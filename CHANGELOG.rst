Changelog
=========

0.16.0 (2020-08-23)
-------------------

- [WARN] Arrow will **drop support** for Python 2.7 and 3.5 in the 1.0.0 release in late September. The 0.16.x and 0.17.x releases are the last to support Python 2.7 and 3.5.
- [NEW] Implemented `PEP 495 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0495/>`_ to handle ambiguous datetimes. This is achieved by the addition of the ``fold`` attribute for Arrow objects. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> before = Arrow(2017, 10, 29, 2, 0, tzinfo='Europe/Stockholm')
    <Arrow [2017-10-29T02:00:00+02:00]>
    >>> before.fold
    0
    >>> before.ambiguous
    True
    >>> after = Arrow(2017, 10, 29, 2, 0, tzinfo='Europe/Stockholm', fold=1)
    <Arrow [2017-10-29T02:00:00+01:00]>
    >>> after = before.replace(fold=1)
    <Arrow [2017-10-29T02:00:00+01:00]>

- [NEW] Added ``normalize_whitespace`` flag to ``arrow.get``. This is useful for parsing log files and/or any files that may contain inconsistent spacing. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> arrow.get("Jun 1 2005     1:33PM", "MMM D YYYY H:mmA", normalize_whitespace=True)
    <Arrow [2005-06-01T13:33:00+00:00]>
    >>> arrow.get("2013-036 \t  04:05:06Z", normalize_whitespace=True)
    <Arrow [2013-02-05T04:05:06+00:00]>

0.15.8 (2020-07-23)

.. code-block:: python

    >>> arw = arrow.utcnow()
    >>> arw.format(arrow.FORMAT_COOKIE)
    'Wednesday, 27-May-2020 10:30:35 UTC'

- [NEW] Added ``humanize`` week granularity translation for Hebrew, Greek, Macedonian, Swedish, Slovak.
- [FIX] ms and μs timestamps are now normalized in ``arrow.get()``, ``arrow.fromtimestamp()``, and ``arrow.utcfromtimestamp()``. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> ts = 1591161115194556
    >>> arw = arrow.get(ts)
    <Arrow [2020-06-03T05:11:55.194556+00:00]>
    >>> arw.timestamp
    1591161115

- [FIX] Refactored and updated Macedonian, Hebrew, Korean, and Portuguese locales.

0.15.6 (2020-04-29)
-------------------

- [NEW] Added support for parsing and formatting `ISO 8601 week dates <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date>`_ via a new token ``W``, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> arrow.get("2013-W29-6", "W")
    <Arrow [2013-07-20T00:00:00+00:00]>
    >>> utc=arrow.utcnow()
    >>> utc
    <Arrow [2020-01-23T18:37:55.417624+00:00]>
    >>> utc.format("W")
    '2020-W04-4'

- [NEW] Formatting with ``x`` token (microseconds) is now possible, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> dt = arrow.utcnow()
    >>> dt.format("x")
    '1585669870688329'
    >>> dt.format("X")
    '1585669870'

- [NEW] Added bounds parameter to ``span_range``, ``interval`` and ``span`` methods. This allows you to include or exclude the start and end values.
- [NEW] ``arrow.get()`` can now create arrow objects from a timestamp with a timezone, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> arrow.get(1367900664, tzinfo=tz.gettz('US/Pacific'))
    <Arrow [2013-05-06T21:24:24-07:00]>

- [NEW] ``humanize`` can now combine multiple levels of granularity, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> later140 = arrow.utcnow().shift(seconds=+8400)
    >>> later140.humanize(granularity="minute")
    'in 139 minutes'
    >>> later140.humanize(granularity=["hour", "minute"])
    'in 2 hours and 19 minutes'

- [NEW] Added Hong Kong locale (``zh_hk``).

0.15.3 (2019-11-02)
-------------------

- [NEW] ``factory.get()`` can now create arrow objects from a ISO calendar tuple, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> arrow.get((2013, 18, 7))
    <Arrow [2013-05-05T00:00:00+00:00]>

- [NEW] Added a new token ``x`` to allow parsing of integer timestamps with milliseconds and microseconds.
- [NEW] Formatting now supports escaping of characters using the same syntax as parsing, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> arw = arrow.now()
    >>> fmt = "YYYY-MM-DD h [h] m"
    >>> arw.format(fmt)
    '2019-11-02 3 h 32'

- [NEW] Added ``humanize`` week granularity translations for Chinese, Spanish and Vietnamese.

- [FIX] Fixed a bug that caused Arrow to fail when passed a negative timestamp string.
- [FIX] Fixed a bug that caused Arrow to fail when passed a datetime object with ``tzinfo`` of type ``StaticTzInfo``.

0.15.0 (2019-09-08)
-------------------

- [NEW] Added support for DDD and DDDD ordinal date tokens. The following functionality is now possible: ``arrow.get("1998-045")``, ``arrow.get("1998-45", "YYYY-DDD")``, ``arrow.get("1998-045", "YYYY-DDDD")``.
- [NEW] ISO 8601 basic format for dates and times is now supported (e.g. ``YYYYMMDDTHHmmssZ``).
- [NEW] Added ``humanize`` week granularity translations for French, Russian and Swiss German locales.
- [CHANGE] Timestamps of type ``str`` are no longer supported **without a format string** in the ``arrow.get()`` method. This change was made to support the ISO 8601 basic format and to address bugs such as `#447 <https://github.com/arrow-py/arrow/issues/447>`_.

The following will NOT work in v0.15.0:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> arrow.get("1565358758")
    >>> arrow.get("1565358758.123413")

The following will work in v0.15.0:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> arrow.get("1565358758", "X")
    >>> arrow.get("1565358758.123413", "X")
    >>> arrow.get(1565358758)
    >>> arrow.get(1565358758.123413)

- [CHANGE] When a meridian token (a|A) is passed and no meridians are available for the specified locale (e.g. unsupported or untranslated) a ``ParserError`` is raised.
- [CHANGE] The timestamp token (``X``) will now match float timestamps of type ``str``: ``arrow.get(“1565358758.123415”, “X”)``.
- [CHANGE] Strings with leading and/or trailing whitespace will no longer be parsed without a format string. Please see `the docs <https://arrow.readthedocs.io/#regular-expressions>`_ for ways to handle this.
- [FIX] The timestamp token (``X``) will now only match on strings that **strictly contain integers and floats**, preventing incorrect matches.
- [FIX] Most instances of ``arrow.get()`` returning an incorrect ``Arrow`` object from a partial parsing match have been eliminated. The following issue have been addressed: `#91 <https://github.com/arrow-py/arrow/issues/91>`_, `#196 <https://github.com/arrow-py/arrow/issues/196>`_, `#396 <https://github.com/arrow-py/arrow/issues/396>`_, `#434 <https://github.com/arrow-py/arrow/issues/434>`_, `#447 <https://github.com/arrow-py/arrow/issues/447>`_, `#456 <https://github.com/arrow-py/arrow/issues/456>`_, `#519 <https://github.com/arrow-py/arrow/issues/519>`_, `#538 <https://github.com/arrow-py/arrow/issues/538>`_, `#560 <https://github.com/arrow-py/arrow/issues/560>`_.

0.14.7 (2019-09-04)
-------------------

- [CHANGE] ``ArrowParseWarning`` will no longer be printed on every call to ``arrow.get()`` with a datetime string. The purpose of the warning was to start a conversation about the upcoming 0.15.0 changes and we appreciate all the feedback that the community has given us!

0.14.6 (2019-08-28)
-------------------

- [NEW] Added support for ``week`` granularity in ``Arrow.humanize()``. For example, ``arrow.utcnow().shift(weeks=-1).humanize(granularity="week")`` outputs "a week ago". This change introduced two new untranslated words, ``week`` and ``weeks``, to all locale dictionaries, so locale contributions are welcome!
- [NEW] Fully translated the Brazilian Portugese locale.
- [CHANGE] Updated the Macedonian locale to inherit from a Slavic base.
- [FIX] Fixed a bug that caused ``arrow.get()`` to ignore tzinfo arguments of type string (e.g. ``arrow.get(tzinfo="Europe/Paris")``).
- [FIX] Fixed a bug that occurred when ``arrow.Arrow()`` was instantiated with a ``pytz`` tzinfo object.
- [FIX] Fixed a bug that caused Arrow to fail when passed a sub-second token, that when rounded, had a value greater than 999999 (e.g. ``arrow.get("2015-01-12T01:13:15.9999995")``). Arrow should now accurately propagate the rounding for large sub-second tokens.

0.14.5 (2019-08-09)
-------------------

- [NEW] Added Afrikaans locale.
- [CHANGE] Removed deprecated ``replace`` shift functionality. Users looking to pass plural properties to the ``replace`` function to shift values should use ``shift`` instead.
- [FIX] Fixed bug that occurred when ``factory.get()`` was passed a locale kwarg.

0.14.4 (2019-07-30)
-------------------

- [FIX] Fixed a regression in 0.14.3 that prevented a tzinfo argument of type string to be passed to the ``get()`` function. Functionality such as ``arrow.get("2019072807", "YYYYMMDDHH", tzinfo="UTC")`` should work as normal again.
- [CHANGE] Moved ``backports.functools_lru_cache`` dependency from ``extra_requires`` to ``install_requires`` for ``Python 2.7`` installs to fix `#495 <https://github.com/arrow-py/arrow/issues/495>`_.

0.14.3 (2019-07-28)
-------------------

- [NEW] Added full support for Python 3.8.
