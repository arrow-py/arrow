# Arrow - Better dates & times for Python
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/crsmithdev/arrow.png)](https://travis-ci.org/crsmithdev/arrow)

### See documentation at:  [crsmithdev.com/arrow](http://crsmithdev.com/arrow)

## Overview

Arrow is a Python module that offers a smooth, sensible way of creating, manipulating, formatting and converting dates and times.  Arrow is simple, lightweight and heavily inspired by [moment.js](https://github.com/timrwood/moment/) and [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests).

## Why?

Python's standard library and some other low-level modules offer complete functionality but don't work very well from a usability perspective:

* Too many modules:  datetime, time, calendar, dateutil, pytz
* Time zones and timestamp conversions are verbose and error-prone
* Time zones are explicit, naivete is the norm
* Gaps in functionality:  ISO-8601 parsing, timespans, humanization

## Key features

* Implements the datetime interface
* TZ-aware & UTC by default
* Concise, intelligent interface for creation
* Attribute manipulation, plural names
* Rich parsing & formatting options
* Timezone conversion
* Simple timestamp handling
* Time spans, floors and ceilings
* Humanization

## Installation
```bash
$ pip install arrow
```

## Quickstart
```python
>>> import arrow
>>> utc = arrow.utcnow()
>>> utc
<Arrow [2013-05-07T03:56:38.560988+00:00]>
>>> utc.hours -=1
>>> utc
<Arrow [2013-05-07T02:56:38.560988+00:00]>
>>> local = utc.to('US/Pacific')
>>> local
<Arrow [2013-05-06T19:56:38.560988-07:00]>
>>> local.timestamp
1367895398
>>> local.format('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss ZZ')
'2013-05-06 19:56:38 -07:00'
```
