**Arrow** is a Python library that offers a sensible and human-friendly approach to creating, manipulating, formatting and converting dates, times and timestamps. It implements and updates the datetime type, plugging gaps in functionality and providing an intelligent module API that supports many common creation scenarios. Simply put, it helps you work with dates and times with fewer imports and a lot less code.

Arrow is named after the `arrow of time <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time>`_ and is heavily inspired by `moment.js <https://github.com/moment/moment>`_ and `requests <https://github.com/psf/requests>`_.

Why use Arrow over built-in modules?
------------------------------------

Python's standard library and some other low-level modules have near-complete date, time and timezone functionality, but don't work very well from a usability perspective:

- Too many modules: datetime, time, calendar, dateutil, pytz and more
- Too many types: date, time, datetime, tzinfo, timedelta, relativedelta, etc.
- Timezones and timestamp conversions are verbose and unpleasant
- Timezone naivety is the norm
- Gaps in functionality: ISO 8601 parsing, timespans, humanization

Features
--------

- Fully-implemented, drop-in replacement for datetime
- Supports Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8
- Timezone-aware and UTC by default
- Provides super-simple creation options for many common input scenarios
- :code:`shift` method with support for relative offsets, including weeks
- Formats and parses strings automatically
- Wide support for ISO 8601
- Timezone conversion
- Timestamp available as a property
- Generates time spans, ranges, floors and ceilings for time frames ranging from microsecond to year
- Humanizes and supports a growing list of contributed locales
- Extensible for your own Arrow-derived types

Quick Start
-----------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install Arrow, use `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/>`_ or `pipenv <https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/>`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -U arrow

Example Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import arrow
    >>> arrow.get('2013-05-11T21:23:58.970460+07:00')
    <Arrow [2013-05-11T21:23:58.970460+07:00]>

    >>> utc = arrow.utcnow()
    >>> utc
    <Arrow [2013-05-11T21:23:58.970460+00:00]>

    >>> utc = utc.shift(hours=-1)
    >>> utc
    <Arrow [2013-05-11T20:23:58.970460+00:00]>

    >>> local = utc.to('US/Pacific')
    >>> local
    <Arrow [2013-05-11T13:23:58.970460-07:00]>

    >>> local.timestamp
    1368303838

    >>> local.format()
    '2013-05-11 13:23:58 -07:00'

    >>> local.format('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss ZZ')
    '2013-05-11 13:23:58 -07:00'

    >>> local.humanize()
    'an hour ago'

    >>> local.humanize(locale='ko_kr')
    '1ì‹œê°„ ì „'
